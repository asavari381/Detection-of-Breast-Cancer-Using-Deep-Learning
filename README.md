# Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-Using-Deep-Learning
Detection of Breast Cancer using Airflow and Snowflake                                                         
This project fueled my passion for healthcare technology, allowing me to directly contribute to life-saving solutions in the medical field by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
•	Employed Flask/Django to develop and deploy a web interface, integrating multiple large data sources to present actionable insights derived from machine learning models.
•	Scaled machine learning algorithms such as KNN and K-means to efficiently handle and analyze millions of data entries for predictive modeling and classification tasks.
•	Built an application program interface using Gradio API to design a deep learning pipeline that could detect cases of breast cancer in mammograms (X-ray pictures of breasts) by the presence of tumors, whether they are benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and their location in the mammogram achieved a 15% increase in early detection of breast cancer cases.  
•	Collected 100,000 medical reports utilising Natural Language Processing algorithms to analyze clinical records, resulting in a 20% improvement in the accuracy of identifying high-risk patients.
